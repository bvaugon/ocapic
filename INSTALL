                   Installing OCaPIC on a Unix machine
                   -----------------------------------

PREREQUISITES

* The OCaml standard distribution

* A C compiler (ex: the GNU C compiler `gcc')

* A PIC assembler (ex: `gpasm' from the `gputils' package)


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Configure the system. From the top directory, do:

        ./configure

This generates the two configuration files "Makefile.conf" and "config.ml"
in the ./etc/ subdirectory.

The "configure" script accepts the following options:

-bindir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/bin)
        Directory where the binaries will be installed.

-libdir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/lib/ocapic)
        Directory where the OCaml library PIC tools will be installed.

-mandir <dir>                   (default: /usr/local/man)
        Directory where the manual pages will be installed.

-prefix <dir>                   (default: /usr/local)
        Set bindir, libdir and mandir to
        <dir>/bin, <dir>/lib/ocapic, <dir>/man respectively.

-cc <C compiler and options>    (default: gcc if available, cc otherwise)
        C compiler to use for building the system.

-pics <regexp>                  (default: 18f4620)
        Set OCaml modules representing PICs to generate in the library.
        The value of <regexp> can be '18f4685' or '18f46.*' for an exemple.
        Warning: compilation time (at step 2) of PIC modules can be very long.

Example:

  Standard installation in /usr/{bin,lib,man} instead of /usr/local:
    ./configure -prefix /usr


2- From the top directory, do:

        make

This builds the bytecode adapter and the new standard library in local
directories: ./bin/ and ./lib/.


3- You can now install the OCaPIC system. This will create the
following commands (in the binary directory selected during
autoconfiguration):

        ocapic         the OCaml compiler linked to the new library
        bc2asm         the OCaml bytecode adapter

From the top directory, become superuser and do:

        umask 022       # make sure to give read & execute permission to all
        make install

4- Installation is complete. Time to clean up. From the toplevel
directory, do:

        make clean


UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- If configuration files (./etc/Makefile.conf and ./etc/config.ml)
have been lost, run again ./configure from the top directory with the
same options as at step 1 of installation.

2- From the top directory, become superuser and do:

        make uninstall
